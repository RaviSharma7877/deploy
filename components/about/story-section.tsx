              After leading product, revenue, and engineering inside scale-ups, we watched teams burn runway on
              agencies and disconnected contractors. E2S_HuB was born to embed the exact trio companies need: a product
              leader who owns the outcome, an operator who ties growth and RevOps together, and a technologist who
              builds AI-native systems that wonâ€™t buckle when volume hits. No silos, only accountable pods shipping in
              market.
